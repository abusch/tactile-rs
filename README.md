# tactile-rs

This library is a pure Rust port of [tactile](https://github.com/isohedral/tactile), a library for representing, manipulating, and drawing isohedral tilings on the plane created by [Craig S. Kaplan](https://github.com/isohedral) based on his [PhD thesis](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/other/phd/).

See [`tactile`'s original README file](https://github.com/isohedral/tactile/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to use this library.
