This library is a pure Rust port of [tactile](https://github.com/isohedral/tactile), a library for representing, manipulating, and drawing isohedral tilings on the plane created by [Craig S. Kaplan](https://github.com/isohedral) based on his [PhD thesis](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/other/phd/).

See [`tactile`'s original README file](https://github.com/isohedral/tactile/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to use this library.

## Examples

There's a couple of [examples](/examples) that show how to use the API: a simple one that displays some
information about a given tiling, and slightly more complex one that shows how to draw tiles to
fill a region of the plane (in text mode):
